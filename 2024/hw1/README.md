# Min-Llama Assignment
This assignment is modified based on [minillama-assignment, by Vijay Viswanathan, part of Carnegie Mellon University's CS11-711](https://github.com/neubig/minllama-assignment)

In this assignment, you will implement some important components of the Llama2 model to better understanding its architecture. 
You will then perform sentence classification on ``sst`` dataset and ``cfimdb`` dataset with this model.

## Assignment Details

### Your task
The code to implement can be found in `llama.py`, `classifier.py` and `optimizer.py`. You are reponsible for writing _core components_ of Llama2 (one of the leading open source language models). In doing so, you will gain a strong understanding of neural language modeling. We will load pretrained weights for your language model from `stories42M.pt`; an 8-layer, 42M parameter language model pretrained on the [TinyStories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759) dataset (a dataset of machine-generated children's stories). This model is small enough that it can be trained (slowly) without a GPU. You are encouraged to use Colab or a personal GPU machine (e.g. a Macbook) to be able to iterate more quickly.

Once you have implemented these components, you will test our your model in 3 settings:
1) Run `python run_llama.py` to generate a text completion (starting with the sentence `"I have wanted to see this thriller for a while, and it didn't disappoint. Keanu Reeves, playing the hero John Wick, is"`). You should see coherent, grammatical English being generated (though the content and topicality of the completion may be absurd, since this LM was pretrained exclusively on children's stories).
2) Perform zero-shot, prompt-based sentiment analysis on two datasets (SST-5 and CFIMDB). This will give bad results (roughly equal to choosing a random target class).
3) Perform task-specific finetuning of your Llama2 model, after implementing a classification head in `classifier.py`. This will give much stronger classification results.
4) If you've done #1-3 well, you will get an 100!

### Important Notes
* Create a conda environment `conda create -n llama_hw python=3.11` then activate it `conda activate llama_hw` (if you are using Google Colab, neglect this step)
* run `bash setup.sh`
* Download the pretrained weights from [weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uaxXVTketRlpnm1gEofFNTTLG_sPkLsi/view?usp=drive_link)
* There is a detailed description of the code structure in [structure.md](./structure.md), including a description of which parts you will need to implement.
* You are only allowed to use libraries that are installed by `setup.sh`, no other external libraries are allowed (e.g., `transformers`).
* We will run your code with commands below (under "Reference outputs/accuracies"), so make sure that whatever your best results are reproducible using these commands.
    * Do not change any of the existing command options (including defaults) or add any new required parameters

## Reference outputs/accuracies: 

*Text Continuation* (`python run_llama.py --option generate`)
You should see continuations of the sentence `I have wanted to see this thriller for a while, and it didn't disappoint. Keanu Reeves, playing the hero John Wick, is...`. We will generate two continuations - one with temperature 0.0 (which should have a reasonably coherent, if unusual, completion) and one with temperature 1.0 (which is likely to be logically inconsistent and may contain some coherence or grammar errors).

*Zero Shot Prompting*
Zero-Shot Prompting for SST:

`python run_llama.py --option prompt --batch_size 10  --train data/sst-train.txt --dev data/sst-dev.txt --test data/sst-test.txt --label-names data/sst-label-mapping.json --dev_out sst-dev-prompting-output.txt --test_out sst-test-prompting-output.txt [--use_gpu]`

Prompting for SST:
Dev Accuracy: 0.213
Test Accuracy: 0.224

Zero-Shot Prompting for CFIMDB:

`python run_llama.py --option prompt --batch_size 10  --train data/cfimdb-train.txt --dev data/cfimdb-dev.txt --test data/cfimdb-test.txt --label-names data/cfimdb-label-mapping.json --dev_out cfimdb-dev-prompting-output.txt --test_out cfimdb-test-prompting-output.txt [--use_gpu]`

Prompting for CFIMDB:
Dev Accuracy: 0.498
Test Accuracy: -

*Classification Finetuning*

`python run_llama.py --option finetune --epochs 5 --lr 2e-5 --batch_size 80  --train data/sst-train.txt --dev data/sst-dev.txt --test data/sst-test.txt --label-names data/sst-label-mapping.json --dev_out sst-dev-finetuning-output.txt --test_out sst-test-finetuning-output.txt [--use_gpu]`

Finetuning for SST:
Dev Accuracy: 0.414
Test Accuracy: 0.418

`python run_llama.py --option finetune --epochs 5 --lr 2e-5 --batch_size 10  --train data/cfimdb-train.txt --dev data/cfimdb-dev.txt --test data/cfimdb-test.txt --label-names data/cfimdb-label-mapping.json --dev_out cfimdb-dev-finetuning-output.txt --test_out cfimdb-test-finetuning-output.txt [--use_gpu]`

Finetuning for CFIMDB:
Dev Accuracy: 0.800
Test Accuracy: -

Mean reference accuracies over 10 random seeds with their standard deviation shown in brackets.

### Submission

**Code:**
You will submit a full code package, with output files, on **Canvas**. This package will be checked by the TAs in the 1-2 weeks 
   after the assignment for its correctness and executability.

#### Canvas Submission

For submission via [Canvas](https://oc.sjtu.edu.cn/),
the submission file should be a zip file with the following structure:
```

```

`prepare_submit.py` can help to create(1) or check(2) the to-be-submitted zip file. It
will throw assertion errors if the format is not expected, and *submissions that fail
this check will be graded down*.

Usage:
1. To create and check a zip file with your outputs, run
   `python3 prepare_submit.py path/to/your/output/dir 学号_名字`
2. To check your zip file, run
   `python3 prepare_submit.py path/to/your/submit/zip/file.zip 学号_名字`

Please double check this before you submit to Canvas!


### Grading
* 100: You implement all the missing pieces and the original ``classifier.py`` with ``--option prompt`` and ``--option finetune`` code such that coherent text (i.e. mostly grammatically well-formed) can be generated and the model achieves comparable accuracy (within 0.05 accuracy for SST or 0.15 accuracy for CFIMDB) to our reference implementation.
* 95: You implement all the missing pieces and the original ``classifier.py`` with ``--option prompt`` and ``--option finetune`` code but coherent text is not generated (i.e. generated text is not well-formed English) or accuracy is not comparable to the reference (accuracy is more than 0.05 accuracy or 0.15 accuracy from our reference scores, for for SST and CFIMDB, respectively).
* 90: All missing pieces are implemented and pass tests in ``sanity_check.py`` (llama implementation) and ``optimizer_test.py`` (optimizer implementation)
* 85 or below: Some parts of the missing pieces are not implemented.

If your results can be confirmed through the submitted files, but there are problems with your
code submitted through Canvas, such as not being properly formatted, not executing in
the appropriate amount of time, etc., you will be graded down 5 points (e.g. 100 -> 95 or 95 -> 90).
