1 ||| An often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach

0 ||| When -LRB- De Palma 's -RRB- bad , he 's really bad , and Femme Fatale ranks with the worst he has done .

1 ||| It 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish .
1 ||| Culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
2 ||| In the end , Ted Bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context .
1 ||| ... -LRB- like -RRB- channel surfing between the Discovery Channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .
1 ||| A movie that , rather than skip along the Seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy Paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .
1 ||| Shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by Joaquin Baca-Asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
0 ||| Imagine a really bad community theater production of West Side Story without the songs .
0 ||| Soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
0 ||| A one-trick pony whose few T&A bits still ca n't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable .
2 ||| The worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
2 ||| It may be a prize winner , but Teacher is a bomb .
3 ||| The production values are up there .
4 ||| The use of CGI and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .
3 ||| The voices are fine as well .
1 ||| The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .

1 ||| Well , it does go on forever .
0 ||| This overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the Rush Hour crowd .

0 ||| If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did n't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
1 ||| Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it 's all over his Chelsea Walls .
2 ||| Equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .
1 ||| I 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s .
0 ||| While the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .
4 ||| If you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .
1 ||| A 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode TV series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect .
1 ||| Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
1 ||| She lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
0 ||| Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
0 ||| To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow : Enter the Fist .
1 ||| It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
0 ||| Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
1 ||| I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland 's class for the music , or to Robin Williams 's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
2 ||| For the most part , the ingredients are there .
1 ||| But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck 's film from coming together .
4 ||| An earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives .
1 ||| It 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
1 ||| A mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin 's City Lights seem dispassionate by comparison .
2 ||| Yes , one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature .
1 ||| It 's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really does n't fit the part .
0 ||| This is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .
0 ||| ... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , I realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time .
2 ||| It 's a trifle .
2 ||| Literally nothing in The Pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
1 ||| Arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .
2 ||| Anyway , for one reason or another , Crush turns into a dire drama partway through .
0 ||| After that , it just gets stupid and maudlin .
3 ||| Too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it 's not a total loss .
2 ||| Chao was Chen Kaige 's assistant for years in China .
0 ||| He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
1 ||| A mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .
0 ||| The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
1 ||| Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
0 ||| The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
2 ||| If it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than Half Past Dead .
0 ||| So what is the point ?
3 ||| Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
1 ||| This is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
4 ||| When it 's all wet , Blue Crush is highly enjoyable .
1 ||| When it 's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper .
3 ||| Most new movies have a bright sheen .
0 ||| Some , like Ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
1 ||| The story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
2 ||| You see Robert De Niro singing - and dancing to - West Side Story show tunes .
3 ||| Choose your reaction : A. -RRB- That sure is funny !
0 ||| B. -RRB- That sure is pathetic !
0 ||| A sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
2 ||| This dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old Hollywood saw : Evil is interesting and good is boring .
1 ||| Before long , the film starts playing like General Hospital crossed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Dog Day Afternoon .
1 ||| The charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
1 ||| Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
2 ||| But what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
1 ||| A silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .
1 ||| Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .
1 ||| The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and Clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix .
1 ||| Flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern 's thick , working-class Scottish accent .
0 ||| Lame , haphazard teen comedy .
1 ||| It 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning U.S. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in French -LRB- well , mostly -RRB- with English subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that .
0 ||| This miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing Flatbush machismo will get it through .
1 ||| Expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially Seven , which director William Malone slavishly copies .
1 ||| Nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .
1 ||| It 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks .
1 ||| It 's laughing at us .
1 ||| Might have been better off as a documentary , with less of Mr. Eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
2 ||| Every good actor needs to do his or her own Hamlet .
3 ||| For Benigni it was n't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio .
1 ||| It might as well have been Problem Child IV .
1 ||| Arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
2 ||| Both awful and appealing .
1 ||| The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
1 ||| Nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
1 ||| We are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .
1 ||| Helmer DeVito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' TV and revenge .
0 ||| It would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
0 ||| I hated every minute of it .
1 ||| -LRB- T -RRB- hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the Stepford Wives mentality does n't work in a modern context .
1 ||| Obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of Hey Arnold !
4 ||| The Movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
2 ||| There 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 MGM version .
1 ||| A simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
3 ||| Roger Michell , who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England , gets too artsy in his American debut .
2 ||| There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double .
2 ||| Anthony Hopkins ?
2 ||| Big deal !
2 ||| We 've already seen the prequel to The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal -- and it was better the first time .
1 ||| Ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .
1 ||| If this is an example of the type of project that Robert Redford 's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it 's time to rethink independent films .
1 ||| Pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless Todd Solondzian satire and callow student film .
1 ||| Not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it 's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined TV amiability that Allen personifies .
2 ||| It 's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film , because it is n't .
0 ||| It 's just incredibly dull .
1 ||| The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
1 ||| A cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
3 ||| Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .
1 ||| But he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
1 ||| Egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
2 ||| It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
1 ||| Despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like -LRB- Seinfeld 's -RRB- revered TV show , about pretty much nothing .
0 ||| Shadyac shoots his film like an M. Night Shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .
1 ||| Plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
1 ||| There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
0 ||| The story 's so preposterous that I did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
2 ||| I 've heard that the fans of the first Men in Black have come away hating the second one .
2 ||| I wonder why .
1 ||| They felt like the same movie to me .
2 ||| Despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , Witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be America 's Sweetheart .
1 ||| An ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .
1 ||| Birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .
3 ||| De Niro and McDormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest .
1 ||| Even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for Disney .
2 ||| That is essentially what 's missing from Blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .
1 ||| A compendium of Solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
0 ||| It is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling -LRB- and an uneasy alliance , at that -RRB- .
1 ||| The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
0 ||| You 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot .
0 ||| You 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
2 ||| Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .
1 ||| Ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke .
1 ||| Flat , but with a revelatory performance by Michelle Williams .
1 ||| Little more than a frothy vanity project .
2 ||| The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
1 ||| Verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
1 ||| For all its surface frenzy , High Crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .
0 ||| The Sum of All Fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an American football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
2 ||| Alex Nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget NC-17 version of Tank Girl .
1 ||| The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
1 ||| IHOPs do n't pile on this much syrup .
3 ||| For the most part , I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
0 ||| focuses on Joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with Spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that I became mad that I wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device .
0 ||| This series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie .
1 ||| A bit of an unwieldy mess .
1 ||| With a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual Broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .
1 ||| The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
1 ||| The movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
1 ||| A gimmick in search of a movie : how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .
1 ||| ... the last time I saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my SATs .
1 ||| ... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .
2 ||| ... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .
1 ||| It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
2 ||| It 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
2 ||| Largely a for-fans artifact .
1 ||| There 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
1 ||| Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
1 ||| There 's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .
1 ||| -LRB- I -RRB- f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing .
0 ||| No reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either .
1 ||| A strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .
0 ||| A boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
1 ||| The vampire thriller Blade II starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
1 ||| When the first few villians are introduced as `` Spider '' and `` Snake '' you know you 're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak .
1 ||| An Afterschool Special without the courage of its convictions .
2 ||| The final result makes for adequate entertainment , I suppose , but anyone who has seen Chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
1 ||| -LRB- Director -RRB- Byler may yet have a great movie in him , but Charlotte Sometimes is only half of one .
1 ||| So few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
2 ||| It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through .
1 ||| Watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
2 ||| It 's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
1 ||| There are touching moments in Etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
1 ||| Could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes Fatal Attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
2 ||| That 's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan 's existence .
1 ||| I did n't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube , and his skinny buddy Mike Epps , to make like Laurel and Hardy 'n the hood .
0 ||| The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
2 ||| I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
0 ||| The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
2 ||| Immediately .
2 ||| Human Nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
1 ||| -LRB- It 's -RRB- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy Vinnie Jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy .
0 ||| Not even the Hanson Brothers can save it
1 ||| The thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
1 ||| ... -LRB- a -RRB- strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for Rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
0 ||| A sour , nasty offering .
0 ||| Feels like one of those contrived , only-in - Hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating Oscar talk .
0 ||| Obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .
2 ||| It tells more than it shows .
1 ||| Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
1 ||| The film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
1 ||| Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
1 ||| Not every animated film from Disney will become a classic , but forgive me if I 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' .
0 ||| Do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
0 ||| Nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and Showtime is crammed full of them .
1 ||| Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
2 ||| This is really just another genre picture .
2 ||| Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
2 ||| William Shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot ...
2 ||| A trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
0 ||| Neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
1 ||| Acting , particularly by Tambor , almost makes `` Never Again '' worthwhile , but -LRB- writer\/director -RRB- Schaeffer should follow his titular advice
2 ||| Both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent I Spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie .
1 ||| `` Collateral Damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
0 ||| ` Enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable .
0 ||| A waste of good performances .
0 ||| A dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .
1 ||| I kept thinking over and over again , ' I should be enjoying this . '
1 ||| But I was n't .
1 ||| As conceived by Mr. Schaeffer , Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
0 ||| Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .
1 ||| The essential problem in Orange County is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
0 ||| Just like Hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
0 ||| There is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
1 ||| Where last time jokes flowed out of Cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines .
1 ||| Why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from Shirley Jackson , Richard Matheson ... and puke up something like ROSE RED ?
3 ||| A broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .
1 ||| ... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
0 ||| Lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
3 ||| Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
2 ||| perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .
3 ||| Wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly -LRB- like one of Hubert 's punches -RRB- , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
2 ||| Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
2 ||| This ill-fitting Tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
0 ||| The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
1 ||| Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
2 ||| Kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in Birthday Girl , a film by the stage-trained Jez Butterworth -LRB- Mojo -RRB- that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of British comedies in the post-Full Monty world .
1 ||| Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you 've imagined The Ring .
0 ||| This time Kaufman 's imagination has failed him .
1 ||| An intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .
1 ||| It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
1 ||| Frenetic but not really funny .
1 ||| Taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .
1 ||| If you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at Britney Spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
0 ||| A didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
1 ||| Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .
1 ||| You could nap for an hour and not miss a thing .
2 ||| Director Clare Kilner 's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
0 ||| New Best Friend should n't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 video .
2 ||| Wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together
1 ||| The thrill is -LRB- long -RRB- gone .
0 ||| Began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
2 ||| Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
0 ||| Godawful boring slug of a movie .
1 ||| Dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .
1 ||| Scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
1 ||| ... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .
2 ||| It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .
3 ||| It is also , at times , curiously moving .
1 ||| The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
0 ||| Vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe Ghost Ship .
1 ||| Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .
1 ||| Being author Wells ' great-grandson , you 'd think filmmaker Simon Wells would have more reverence for the material .
0 ||| But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
1 ||| Offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
1 ||| Mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
1 ||| Aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .
1 ||| Accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
1 ||| For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
1 ||| A soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .
1 ||| One groan-inducing familiarity begets another .
0 ||| Although based on a real-life person , John , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
2 ||| Great story , bad idea for a movie .
0 ||| With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams writer\/director\/producer Robert Rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
1 ||| There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
1 ||| It 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
2 ||| `` My god , I 'm behaving like an idiot ! ''
2 ||| Yes , you are , Ben Kingsley .
0 ||| A dreadful live-action movie .
1 ||| Divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .
2 ||| An earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s .
1 ||| A hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future Rice adaptations .
0 ||| All I can say is fuhgeddaboutit .
1 ||| Between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
1 ||| If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .
2 ||| Despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
0 ||| Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
3 ||| A sensual performance from Abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at .
1 ||| Never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
0 ||| Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
0 ||| Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams , for which he should not be forgiven .
0 ||| Why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .
1 ||| The creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine .
3 ||| Whatever Eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .
2 ||| Scotland , PA. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole .
1 ||| It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
1 ||| The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .
1 ||| It 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
0 ||| I cry for I Spy -- or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
0 ||| A boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk 'n' slash .
3 ||| What you would end up with if you took Orwell , Bradbury , Kafka , George Lucas and the Wachowski Brothers and threw them into a blender .
1 ||| But that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients .
2 ||| With recent tensions rekindled by the Kathleen Soliah trial and the upcoming trial of SLA members Emily and William Harris , not to mention Sept. 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate Fire 's bright side .
1 ||| Flaunts its quirky excesses like a New Year 's Eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
0 ||| Writhing under dialogue like ` You 're from two different worlds ' and ` Tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .
0 ||| ... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .
2 ||| Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco 's last album ?
2 ||| Faultlessly professional but finally slight .
0 ||| Schmaltzy and unfunny , Adam Sandler 's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad , Little Nicky bad , 10 Worst List bad .
1 ||| It 's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
0 ||| Scotland , Pa. is a strangely drab romp .
1 ||| Some studio pizazz might have helped .
2 ||| When Perry fists a bull at the Moore Farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .
1 ||| There 's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
0 ||| Too loud , too long and too frantic by half , Die Another Day suggests that the Bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
2 ||| The cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the Festival of Lights as Mr. Deeds was to that of Frank Capra .
0 ||| ... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .
1 ||| The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
1 ||| If we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
1 ||| A modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .
0 ||| Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan .
2 ||| Morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either .
1 ||| There 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
2 ||| All Ms. Jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .
2 ||| Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty .
1 ||| Mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
1 ||| This is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .
0 ||| This is n't just the CliffsNotes version of Nicholas Nickleby , it 's the CliffsNotes with pages missing .
1 ||| Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .
0 ||| Better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
1 ||| So clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .
3 ||| It 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
2 ||| It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a Three 's Company-style laugh track .
1 ||| When the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .
1 ||| Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
1 ||| The movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
3 ||| -LRB- Davis -RRB- has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .
1 ||| Does n't amount to much of anything .
0 ||| Bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
0 ||| So stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
1 ||| The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
2 ||| Enduring love but exhausting cinema .
0 ||| Some of Seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
2 ||| A ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .
1 ||| A long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
1 ||| A little too pat for its own good .
1 ||| There are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .
1 ||| Watching Trouble Every Day , at least if you do n't know what 's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .
1 ||| Well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special .
2 ||| What would Jesus do if He was a film director ?
1 ||| He 'd create a movie better than this .
0 ||| When a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign .
0 ||| A very bad sign .
2 ||| It 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
2 ||| Ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the Russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers .
1 ||| Still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
4 ||| Diane Lane shines in Unfaithful .
1 ||| Almost everything else is wan .
2 ||| I 'm afraid you wo n't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers B-flick with just a suspension of disbelief .
0 ||| Rather , you 'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .
2 ||| So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
2 ||| The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere .
1 ||| The makers of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood should offer a free ticket -LRB- second prize , of course , two free tickets -RRB- to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
1 ||| God help the poor woman if Attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional Yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
0 ||| Let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .
1 ||| Undercover Brother does n't go far enough .
1 ||| It 's just a silly black genre spoof .
2 ||| The film 's implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John .
1 ||| Rates an ` E ' for effort -- and a ` B ' for boring .
2 ||| You 've already seen Heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior Nurse Betty or Sunset Boulevard .
0 ||| Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .
2 ||| A journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which Hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking .
1 ||| The movie bounces all over the map .
1 ||| But buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , Freundlich has made just another safe movie .
0 ||| It 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
2 ||| Not always too whimsical for its own good -LRB- but enough to do harm -RRB- , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
2 ||| It 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original .
2 ||| You 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .
1 ||| Feel bad for King , who 's honestly trying , and Schwartzman , who 's shot himself in the foot .
2 ||| Some actors steal scenes .
1 ||| Tom Green just gives them a bad odor .
0 ||| This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard , but he 's the most obvious one .
2 ||| Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .
1 ||| The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
1 ||| Begins as a promising meditation on one of America 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
1 ||| A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
1 ||| Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report .
1 ||| The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
2 ||| There 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .
1 ||| In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
2 ||| Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` The Longest Yard '' playbook like a checklist .
1 ||| The furious coherence that -LRB- DeNiro -RRB- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
2 ||| Oh , it 's extreme , all right .
0 ||| Extremely dumb .
1 ||| Extremely confusing .
0 ||| Extremely boring .
0 ||| We never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .
1 ||| For a shoot - 'em - up , Ballistic is oddly lifeless .
1 ||| One minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .
1 ||| What happened with Pluto Nash ?
0 ||| How did it ever get made ?
2 ||| We may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .
1 ||| Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` Glory : A Soldier 's Story . ''
1 ||| The result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
1 ||| These spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
1 ||| A long slog for anyone but the most committed Pokemon fan .
0 ||| Matthew McConaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
0 ||| How on earth , or anywhere else , did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?
1 ||| Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
1 ||| With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
1 ||| Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
1 ||| A benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
0 ||| The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
0 ||| It 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
2 ||| It 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
0 ||| It does n't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
0 ||| Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
1 ||| This film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
0 ||| John McTiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
1 ||| It 's also stupider .
1 ||| Director Dirk Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
1 ||| Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .
0 ||| As -LRB- the characters -RRB- get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
1 ||| The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .
1 ||| Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
1 ||| Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny .
1 ||| The fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
1 ||| Anyone who can count to five -LRB- the film 's target market ? -RRB-
1 ||| can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
1 ||| All this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
1 ||| Demme 's loose approach kills the suspense .
0 ||| This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
1 ||| -LRB- Plays -RRB- in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .
1 ||| The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
0 ||| Nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
0 ||| A turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
0 ||| Too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , David Arquette .
1 ||| If Kaufman kept Cameron Diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he 'd have them mate .
0 ||| Trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
0 ||| It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
1 ||| Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ?
1 ||| All that -LRB- Powerpuff Girls -RRB- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin .
2 ||| Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
1 ||| The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
1 ||| Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .
1 ||| As are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
1 ||| Dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
1 ||| Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
1 ||| A great idea becomes a not-great movie .
0 ||| ... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .
3 ||| And if The Hours wins ` Best Picture ' I just might .
1 ||| By the end , I was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
1 ||| Not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny .
1 ||| Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
1 ||| Life is a crock -- or something like it .
0 ||| Made by jackasses for jackasses .
1 ||| Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
1 ||| The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
0 ||| Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .
1 ||| Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much .
1 ||| A bravura exercise in emptiness .
0 ||| Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
1 ||| Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
2 ||| All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto .
1 ||| Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
1 ||| First good , then bothersome .
4 ||| Excellent acting and direction .
1 ||| This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
0 ||| It 's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I 'm prepared to call it a draw .
1 ||| Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
1 ||| So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .
1 ||| Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
1 ||| Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
1 ||| A long-winded , predictable scenario .
1 ||| Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .
1 ||| Although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
1 ||| Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
2 ||| This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
1 ||| It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
2 ||| Melanie eventually slugs the Yankee .
1 ||| Too bad the former Murphy Brown does n't pop Reese back .
1 ||| At the bottom rung of the series ' entries .
0 ||| A real clunker .
2 ||| A well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .
1 ||| A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans .
1 ||| The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
1 ||| Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
1 ||| ... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
1 ||| A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
2 ||| Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
0 ||| As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
1 ||| Will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible Qatsi siblings .
1 ||| Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
0 ||| Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
1 ||| ... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .
1 ||| The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
0 ||| If you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .
1 ||| It virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
0 ||| An instant candidate for worst movie of the year .
2 ||| Despite its title , Amy 's Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .
0 ||| Like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , John Q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .
0 ||| Adam Sandler is to Gary Cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
3 ||| What kids will discover is a new collectible .
1 ||| What parents will suspect is that they 're watching a 76-minute commercial .
2 ||| Beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall ... -LRB- but -RRB- the script goes wrong at several key junctures .
1 ||| Without September 11 , Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie .
0 ||| Now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie .
1 ||| Drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .
2 ||| There 's a disturbing ` Great White Hope ' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .
1 ||| Unless you are in dire need of a Diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it .
0 ||| Wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .
2 ||| The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
1 ||| There 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
0 ||| Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
0 ||| When a film is created SOLELY because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .
1 ||| Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
0 ||| Unfortunately , Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .
1 ||| The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .
1 ||| -LRB- It 's -RRB- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of American Chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
3 ||| The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .
2 ||| Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .
0 ||| But as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess .
1 ||| If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .
0 ||| The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
1 ||| Too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , Frank Novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
2 ||| Overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , -LRB- it 's -RRB- at its worst when it 's actually inside the ring .
2 ||| What is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , The Selection , became in its final form .
1 ||| If this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
2 ||| Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
0 ||| These people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
1 ||| Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno .
2 ||| It does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .
1 ||| Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .
1 ||| The director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -LRB- most notably wretched sound design -RRB- .
1 ||| About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
1 ||| Apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .
0 ||| Marisa Tomei is good , but Just A Kiss is just a mess .
0 ||| Opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
1 ||| The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
2 ||| To portray modern women the way director Davis has done is just unthinkable .
2 ||| Too simple for its own good .
0 ||| Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
1 ||| A chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .
0 ||| Suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .
1 ||| The screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .
0 ||| All the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
0 ||| A trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .
1 ||| The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
2 ||| A subtle variation on I Spit On Your Grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .
1 ||| Reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .
1 ||| As Tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne TV sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .
1 ||| If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son , they 'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich 's World Traveler .
1 ||| The best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
3 ||| A tough go , but Leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .
1 ||| An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .
2 ||| Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
2 ||| Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan , Tom Clancy 's intrepid hero ?
0 ||| Ridiculous .
3 ||| What 's next ?
2 ||| D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones ?
2 ||| Or Tom Green as Han Solo ?
1 ||| The movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
2 ||| The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .
0 ||| These are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
0 ||| If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
1 ||| This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone 's career .
1 ||| I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
1 ||| Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his Rules is barely worth following .
2 ||| The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America .
2 ||| No worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
1 ||| The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
1 ||| At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
1 ||| Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
0 ||| the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : They Might Be Giants ' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
1 ||| Technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
0 ||| The title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
2 ||| The parts are better than the whole -LRB- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York -RRB- .
2 ||| While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production .
1 ||| The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
1 ||| It 's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .
1 ||| Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
0 ||| Any one episode of The Sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
2 ||| Feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network .
1 ||| Lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and Does n't Know How to Have Fun .
3 ||| Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
0 ||| Denzel Washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
0 ||| If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -LRB- literally -RRB- .
2 ||| So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
0 ||| Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
1 ||| There 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
1 ||| I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , and that 's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing .
1 ||| An awkward and indigestible movie .
1 ||| The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
2 ||| Haneke keeps us at arm 's length .
0 ||| Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
0 ||| All the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi .
1 ||| Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
2 ||| There 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .
2 ||| This is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
3 ||| Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?
1 ||| Alas , it 's neither .
1 ||| No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
1 ||| ` Dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .
1 ||| Thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .
1 ||| Now it 's just tired .
2 ||| Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
2 ||| The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
1 ||| A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self-deprecating act against Murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .
1 ||| A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through .
1 ||| The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
1 ||| Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
1 ||| It will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
0 ||| But here 's the real damn : It is n't funny , either .
1 ||| Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
2 ||| The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
0 ||| What you get with Empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead .
1 ||| Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .
1 ||| Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .
1 ||| The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
1 ||| High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
1 ||| The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
0 ||| De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
1 ||| I did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
1 ||| Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .
3 ||| With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .
1 ||| So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
2 ||| Though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal Woody at best .
1 ||| Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
1 ||| Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
1 ||| Sadly , Hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
0 ||| If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
1 ||| This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
0 ||| Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
2 ||| Or a profit .
1 ||| Or some damn thing .
0 ||| The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
0 ||| Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
0 ||| The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
3 ||| I like Frank the Pug , though .
2 ||| A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .
1 ||| Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
1 ||| Moot point .
1 ||| A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
0 ||| Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
2 ||| The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
0 ||| Madonna still ca n't act a lick .
1 ||| Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
1 ||| If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
3 ||| The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
1 ||| But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
4 ||| Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
1 ||| But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
1 ||| Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .
1 ||| Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .
2 ||| Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading .
1 ||| Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
2 ||| Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
1 ||| Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .
1 ||| ... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
1 ||| Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .
1 ||| I 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .
2 ||| Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
2 ||| But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
1 ||| The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
3 ||| A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
1 ||| Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
2 ||| Even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi 's easy-going likableness .
1 ||| The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
3 ||| Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
1 ||| McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
0 ||| A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .
2 ||| The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .
1 ||| Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .
2 ||| Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend .
0 ||| When she speaks , her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .
1 ||| Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time .
1 ||| We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
0 ||| Much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -LRB- the movie 's -RRB- mindset .
2 ||| Well before it 's over , Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
1 ||| Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .
2 ||| Besides , real movie producers are n't this nice .
2 ||| -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .
2 ||| Passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes .
0 ||| For me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .
0 ||| Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
1 ||| Truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .
0 ||| Abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
0 ||| Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
0 ||| Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
0 ||| Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
1 ||| The movie gets muted and routine .
1 ||| The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
1 ||| The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
1 ||| It 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
1 ||| I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
1 ||| K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
1 ||| A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
0 ||| Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
0 ||| The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
1 ||| Feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
2 ||| Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
2 ||| It would have benefitted the dialogue .
2 ||| A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .
2 ||| Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks , Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb , all wrapped up into one .
0 ||| It 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
2 ||| In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .
2 ||| It 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
2 ||| This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .
1 ||| You 've seen them a million times .
2 ||| Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
2 ||| This one does .
0 ||| The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
1 ||| A soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
1 ||| Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .
0 ||| An ungainly , comedy-deficient , B-movie rush job ...
2 ||| A combination of standard , stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
1 ||| An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
1 ||| Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
1 ||| After seeing SWEPT AWAY , I feel sorry for Madonna .
1 ||| Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart 's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
0 ||| A gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of Moore 's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée .
1 ||| Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
1 ||| Boring we did n't .
1 ||| Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to Barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
2 ||| The film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
3 ||| It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
0 ||| A baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -LRB- Woody Allen -RRB- has made in the last twenty years .
1 ||| It wo n't be long before you 'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
0 ||| This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
1 ||| Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
0 ||| There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
0 ||| This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
1 ||| Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
1 ||| The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
1 ||| For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
1 ||| A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .
1 ||| If I Spy were funny -LRB- enough -RRB- or exciting -LRB- enough -RRB- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
1 ||| Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
1 ||| Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
1 ||| A very average science fiction film .
0 ||| Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
2 ||| How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
0 ||| The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
0 ||| The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
1 ||| The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
0 ||| ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
2 ||| A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
1 ||| Those who managed to avoid the Deconstructionist theorizing of French philosopher Jacques Derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary Derrida .
2 ||| Or , you can do something fun tonight .
1 ||| Jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
0 ||| As with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
1 ||| Static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , Hey Arnold !
0 ||| would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
2 ||| For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
1 ||| When it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever .
2 ||| What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
1 ||| While Benigni -LRB- who stars and co-wrote -RRB- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
2 ||| Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ?
1 ||| Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
0 ||| Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .
1 ||| None of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
0 ||| ... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
0 ||| As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
0 ||| Splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
0 ||| ... has virtually no script at all ...
1 ||| Will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
2 ||| This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
2 ||| But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick -LRB- remember Cabin Boy ? -RRB-
2 ||| just pound away .
1 ||| At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
3 ||| Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
1 ||| Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice 's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .
1 ||| The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
0 ||| Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
2 ||| The new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
1 ||| Most of the action setups are incoherent .
1 ||| Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
1 ||| ... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
1 ||| The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
1 ||| Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .
2 ||| There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .
1 ||| The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
1 ||| Sorry , Charlie
1 ||| A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
1 ||| Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but Ahola is simply not an actor .
1 ||| And in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Spencer Tracy .
0 ||| The cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .
1 ||| Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
1 ||| This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .
1 ||| All ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
0 ||| If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
0 ||| Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .
2 ||| Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
1 ||| When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .
1 ||| -LRB- Two -RRB- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .
1 ||| The film is really not so much bad as bland .
1 ||| The central story lacks punch .
1 ||| Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
0 ||| This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age .
1 ||| Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies .
3 ||| A harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
1 ||| What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
1 ||| The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
3 ||| `` Men in Black II , '' has all the earmarks of a sequel .
2 ||| The story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
1 ||| Sucking all the ` classic ' out of Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and Disney-fied adolescent angst ...
2 ||| This 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .
1 ||| While Super Troopers is above Academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
1 ||| A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
1 ||| The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .
1 ||| The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
2 ||| The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
0 ||| A free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .
0 ||| Apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between Newton and Wahlberg could turn an Imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable TV .
1 ||| A well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
0 ||| The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .
4 ||| Must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry .
0 ||| Others may find it migraine-inducing , despite Moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
2 ||| Despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , Super Troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .
0 ||| It 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .
0 ||| I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief .
0 ||| This limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's Tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
1 ||| Kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
2 ||| While obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut .
1 ||| Any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes .
1 ||| Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
3 ||| I loved looking at this movie .
1 ||| I just did n't care as much for the story .
2 ||| Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act .
1 ||| It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
0 ||| fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
2 ||| A gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .
0 ||| It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
2 ||| The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
2 ||| The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .
1 ||| It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .
1 ||| Maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , I want a little more than this .
1 ||| A graceless , witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller .
1 ||| The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
1 ||| Based on a David Leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
2 ||| Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
2 ||| To enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
0 ||| National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
1 ||| This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .
0 ||| Ecks this one off your must-see list .
1 ||| Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek 's novel by some way .
1 ||| It settles for being merely grim .
0 ||| The Irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
2 ||| It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .
0 ||| No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
1 ||| Just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
2 ||| Just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after -LRB- or during -RRB- consumption of its second half .
2 ||| Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it .
2 ||| The New Guy is one of them .
0 ||| This is n't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .
2 ||| Everything that 's worthwhile about Collision Course can already be seen on television .
2 ||| If this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .
2 ||| Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .
1 ||| Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
1 ||| Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .
1 ||| All in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .
1 ||| Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at .
2 ||| Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
1 ||| The film 's center will not hold .
1 ||| Myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
1 ||| Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
1 ||| A great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and Crazy as Hell does n't even have a great ending .
1 ||| Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
1 ||| Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
1 ||| As an actor , The Rock is aptly named .
1 ||| A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .
0 ||| I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
1 ||| Nothing about it fits .
1 ||| As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
1 ||| Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
1 ||| The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
1 ||| Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
1 ||| The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
1 ||| I tried to read the time on my watch .
0 ||| The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
2 ||| Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
1 ||| Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '
1 ||| The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
1 ||| The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
0 ||| The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
1 ||| Once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
1 ||| There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
2 ||| It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .
1 ||| The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
0 ||| Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie .
1 ||| The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
1 ||| Just a bloody mess .
1 ||| Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
1 ||| You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .
2 ||| Has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
1 ||| Bears is bad .
1 ||| Not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' I once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad .
2 ||| As is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
1 ||| George , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .
1 ||| For a film about two mismatched buddies , Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
2 ||| However clever Nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .
1 ||| Extreme Oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it 's still a mistake to go see it .
1 ||| What could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .
0 ||| What will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
1 ||| ... too dull to enjoy .
2 ||| A morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-TV look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off The Sixth Sense .
1 ||| Here 's a self-congratulatory 3D IMAX rah-rah .
4 ||| Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .
1 ||| But even a hero can stumble sometimes .
1 ||| A sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .
3 ||| It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .
1 ||| The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
1 ||| Going to the website may be just as fun -LRB- and scary -RRB- as going to the film .
0 ||| Lacking gravitas , MacDowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .
0 ||| Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .
2 ||| Admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch .
1 ||| For Caine Lovers only .
1 ||| A shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .
0 ||| De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .
0 ||| But like Bruce Springsteen 's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .
1 ||| No , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences .
2 ||| A reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided .
2 ||| The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .
1 ||| Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
3 ||| City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : It 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
1 ||| But what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
2 ||| The Marquis de Sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
1 ||| What could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .
2 ||| The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming .
2 ||| Drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that Three Seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality .
1 ||| A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -LRB- k -RRB- statement .
1 ||| The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
1 ||| Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
1 ||| And forget about any attempt at a plot !
2 ||| It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
2 ||| Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo 's cool jackets .
0 ||| It 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .
1 ||| Showtime is closer to Slowtime .
1 ||| It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just does n't make the cut .
0 ||| The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
2 ||| ` How many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
1 ||| Despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director Peter Mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .
2 ||| Fans of the TV series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored .
0 ||| The only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
1 ||| Barely goes beyond comic book status .
1 ||| It 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .
0 ||| I Spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .
1 ||| It 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
3 ||| An eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .
0 ||| Afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , All the Queen 's Men is finally just one long drag .
1 ||| Maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` Full Frontal '' seems , well , contrived .
2 ||| -LRB- Morgan -RRB- , Judd and Franklin ca n't save the script , rooted in a novel by Joseph Finder , from some opportunism .
2 ||| Passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
1 ||| Safe Conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye .
1 ||| My response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
1 ||| Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
1 ||| Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
1 ||| It 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
2 ||| It 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .
2 ||| A sudsy cautionary tale .
1 ||| A movie that tries to fuse the two ` woods ' but winds up a Bolly-Holly masala mess .
3 ||| Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
1 ||| Their film falters , however , in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that I 'd hoped the movie would avoid .
1 ||| Leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .
0 ||| Watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .
1 ||| As your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
1 ||| Unfortunately , as a writer , Mr. Montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
1 ||| On the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... It 's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there .
1 ||| The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
1 ||| One of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
1 ||| ... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .
0 ||| Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
3 ||| The film is surprisingly well-directed by Brett Ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
1 ||| Warmed-over Tarantino by way of wannabe Elmore Leonard .
1 ||| -LRB- Sen 's -RRB- soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .
0 ||| Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome .
1 ||| Sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
0 ||| Do n't waste your money .
2 ||| Though certainly original in form , Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score .
2 ||| There are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv .
1 ||| There 's not enough to sustain the comedy .
1 ||| Like those to Rome , all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .
2 ||| We may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the Balkans conflict .
0 ||| You 're better off staying home and watching The X-Files .
1 ||| Chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .
2 ||| Bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .
1 ||| This is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .
1 ||| Friday After Next has the same problem that Next Friday did -- it 's called Where 's Chris Tucker When You Need Him ?
2 ||| This film is full of rabbits .
2 ||| Brimful .
1 ||| But like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
1 ||| I weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider Blue Crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
1 ||| I kept wishing I was watching a documentary about the wartime Navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious Hollywood hoo-ha .
1 ||| No number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .
0 ||| A movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious Charlie Kaufman might object to .
0 ||| Could The Country Bears really be as bad as its trailers ?
2 ||| In a word -- yes .
0 ||| If High Crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
1 ||| Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
0 ||| The movie makes absolutely no sense .
0 ||| Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
1 ||| The problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
0 ||| Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
1 ||| Despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
1 ||| Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .
2 ||| The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .
3 ||| That Zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .
2 ||| The Gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .
1 ||| The streets , shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
2 ||| This is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times .
2 ||| Parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss Wilde 's still-contemporary play .
1 ||| Flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .
1 ||| A TV episode inflated past its natural length .
1 ||| Involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .
0 ||| All these developments and challenges facing Santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
1 ||| There are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering .
0 ||| The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
0 ||| The story ... is moldy and obvious .
0 ||| It 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .
0 ||| Suffocated at conception by its Munchausen-by-proxy mum .
1 ||| Punish the vehicle to adore the star .
1 ||| Even if Britney Spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .
1 ||| Big Fat Liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .
1 ||| Usually when I get this much syrup , I like pancakes to go with it .
1 ||| All the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .
1 ||| Glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .
0 ||| Gangs of New York is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .
0 ||| An overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences .
0 ||| Without a strong script and energetic acting , Dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor 's home videos .
2 ||| A mild , reluctant , thumbs down .
1 ||| Strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and B-film thuggery .
1 ||| Schindler 's List it ai n't .
2 ||| A cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency .
0 ||| It 's an awfully derivative story .
2 ||| It 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .
0 ||| About as cutting-edge as Pet Rock : The Movie .
1 ||| With generic sets and B-grade special effects , Jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as TV 's defunct Cleopatra 2525 .
1 ||| Not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .
1 ||| Winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .
1 ||| Oft-described as the antidote to American Pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
2 ||| The pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes .
1 ||| The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
1 ||| With its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , The Ring makes its stupidity more than obvious .
0 ||| It 's painful .
1 ||| An uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .
2 ||| Sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
0 ||| An atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .
1 ||| Half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
1 ||| Writer\/director John McKay ignites some charming chemistry between Kate and Jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and Kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable .
1 ||| -LRB- Newton -RRB- wanders through CHARLIE completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality .
0 ||| Unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me .
0 ||| I found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
0 ||| A lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .
1 ||| The best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations .
1 ||| Then lower them a bit more .
2 ||| When not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since Macy Gray 's game of Chinese whispers with Mr Bean .
1 ||| Cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
1 ||| A woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect .
1 ||| ` Abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let Dante 's gloomy words be your guide .
2 ||| What begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy .
1 ||| A grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .
1 ||| Birot 's directorial debut -LRB- she co-wrote the script with Christophe Honoré -RRB- is n't so much bad as it is bland .
0 ||| Watching the film is like reading a Times Portrait of Grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
1 ||| Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long 's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .
3 ||| Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the Police Academy series .
3 ||| Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic .
1 ||| If this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
1 ||| A frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience .
2 ||| Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
0 ||| `` An entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . ''
1 ||| Pryor Lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
0 ||| What 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
1 ||| The stories here suffer from the chosen format .
1 ||| While the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
2 ||| Just how extreme are these ops ?
1 ||| I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
1 ||| The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
0 ||| John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
0 ||| The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
2 ||| Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
1 ||| Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
0 ||| The Master Of Disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
1 ||| The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... Alas , Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman -LRB- who never gets to play that flute -RRB- has all the charm of a meltdown .
0 ||| The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .
1 ||| It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .
0 ||| A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
1 ||| None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
0 ||| Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
2 ||| Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
1 ||| Fails to bring as much to the table .
1 ||| A film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick .
0 ||| Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
1 ||| If you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
1 ||| I hate this movie
3 ||| An imaginative comedy\/thriller .
4 ||| -LRB- A -RRB- rare , beautiful film .
4 ||| -LRB- An -RRB- hilarious romantic comedy .
3 ||| Never -LRB- sinks -RRB- into exploitation .
0 ||| -LRB- U -RRB- nrelentingly stupid .
