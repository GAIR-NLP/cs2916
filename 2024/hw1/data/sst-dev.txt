3 ||| One of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling Blair Witch or The Others .
4 ||| Maud and Roland 's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but LaBute pulls off a neater trick in Possession : He makes language sexy .

3 ||| It has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience .

2 ||| And I 've decided to leave a light on every night from now on .
3 ||| This tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , Nicholas Meyer 's Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country .

2 ||| Beneath Clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from Rabbit-Proof Fence .

3 ||| Even if you do n't think -LRB- Kissinger 's -RRB- any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he 'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch .
3 ||| The story and structure are well-honed .
3 ||| Fresnadillo 's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that wo n't go away .

2 ||| Van Wilder does n't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like Tomcats , Freddy Got Fingered , and Slackers .
1 ||| The piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones .
1 ||| Very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant Achilles ' heel in `` Stuart Little 2 `` : There 's just no story , folks .
2 ||| The plot combines The Blues Brothers and Almost Famous -LRB- but with bears , and a G rating -RRB- , with an excruciating dollop of Disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure .
0 ||| No way I can believe this load of junk .
2 ||| `` Roger Michell -LRB- '' Notting Hill `` -RRB- directs a morality thriller . ''
0 ||| It 's dumb , but more importantly , it 's just not scary .
0 ||| There is no pleasure in watching a child suffer .
0 ||| Just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame .
1 ||| The movie 's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach .
2 ||| But is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ?
1 ||| Even with a green Mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , Kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting .
1 ||| And that leaves a hole in the center of The Salton Sea .
2 ||| There 's just no currency in deriding James Bond for being a clichÃ©d , doddering , misogynistic boy 's club .
0 ||| When the film ended , I felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while .
2 ||| Full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
0 ||| The film 's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style .
0 ||| The Iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did .
0 ||| It feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
1 ||| This movie is maddening .
2 ||| It conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought .
1 ||| Should have been someone else -
1 ||| The film is based on truth and yet there is something about it that feels incomplete , as if the real story starts just around the corner .
0 ||| Why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ?
2 ||| Would n't one about their famous dad , author of Death in Venice , etc. , be more valuable ?
1 ||| The lower your expectations , the more you 'll enjoy it .
1 ||| Rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign .
1 ||| ... is an arthritic attempt at directing by Callie Khouri .
0 ||| I had to look away - this was god awful .
2 ||| Even in this less-than-magic kingdom , Reese rules .
1 ||| Velocity represents everything wrong with '' independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the American filmmaking scene .
1 ||| Just one bad idea after another .
1 ||| Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` Swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .
1 ||| Though Moonlight Mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that 's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama .
2 ||| A movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
1 ||| Corpus Collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .
1 ||| The last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage American road-trip drek we 've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
1 ||| It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .
1 ||| A by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise .
0 ||| Involves two mysteries -- one it gives away and the other featuring such badly drawn characters that its outcome hardly matters .
1 ||| Overall the film feels like a low-budget TV pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube .
1 ||| It 's of the quality of a lesser Harrison Ford movie - Six Days , Seven Nights , maybe , or that dreadful Sabrina remake .
1 ||| It appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .
1 ||| Despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults .
0 ||| An unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .
0 ||| This movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .
2 ||| Hey Arnold !
2 ||| The Movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents ' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing .
0 ||| This one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics .
1 ||| Excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters .
1 ||| Once the 50 year old Benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back .
3 ||| A working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .
1 ||| If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
1 ||| There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
0 ||| It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .
4 ||| We have n't seen such hilarity since Say It Is n't So !
0 ||| Expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery .
1 ||| The Cold Turkey would 've been a far better title .
2 ||| The idea of 49-year-old Roberto Benigni playing the wooden boy Pinocchio is scary enough .
1 ||| The reality of the new live-action Pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque .
2 ||| The ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .
1 ||| Zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .
0 ||| Try as I may , I ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` Thank you ! '
1 ||| when Leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .
2 ||| While it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , Yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .
0 ||| It treats women like idiots .
2 ||| Though Catch Me If You Can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
2 ||| Just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
1 ||| A valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the NBA .
1 ||| Impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .
1 ||| For starters , the story is just too slim .
3 ||| So much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
0 ||| The experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
2 ||| The film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , Southern California locations and star power .
1 ||| It has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
0 ||| Almost gags on its own gore .
0 ||| How do you spell clichÃ© ?
2 ||| It 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
0 ||| The moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .
1 ||| While -LRB- Hill -RRB- has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .
0 ||| Too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped .
2 ||| Under 15 ?
4 ||| A giggle a minute .
2 ||| Over age 15 ?
0 ||| Big Fat Waste of Time .
2 ||| Hey Arnold !
0 ||| The Movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .
1 ||| Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
0 ||| This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
0 ||| You really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .
1 ||| In the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
1 ||| Chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .
0 ||| Well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
1 ||| I thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as I slogged my way through Clockstoppers .
2 ||| While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
2 ||| This directorial debut from music video show-off Higuchinsky is all flash .
2 ||| Yes , Ballistic is silly .
0 ||| Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
2 ||| The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
1 ||| The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
1 ||| While it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -LRB- Sugar Hill Gang , etc. -RRB- , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .
0 ||| Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
1 ||| Care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of Fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .
1 ||| Forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
1 ||| Does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .
0 ||| K-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap Hollywood tension .
2 ||| Has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence
2 ||| A ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
0 ||| Whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .
1 ||| Uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
1 ||| The entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
0 ||| The plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .
0 ||| Confirms the nagging suspicion that Ethan Hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .
1 ||| Made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
2 ||| It 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
1 ||| Holden Caulfield did it better .
1 ||| A synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .
1 ||| Oh come on .
0 ||| Like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
2 ||| If it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .
2 ||| Simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
1 ||| Not exactly the Bees Knees
1 ||| It does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28K modem .
2 ||| The kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
2 ||| Makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
1 ||| The film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when Carvey 's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
2 ||| Jacquot 's rendering of Puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
2 ||| In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
1 ||| Chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .
0 ||| It 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
2 ||| This is nothing but familiar territory .
1 ||| In execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , Killers From Space .
0 ||| One of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
1 ||| A broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .
1 ||| Too slow , too long and too little happens .
0 ||| The film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
1 ||| It 's just filler .
1 ||| Sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
1 ||| Utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .
1 ||| A hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the Mason-Dixon line .
0 ||| Scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .
1 ||| It 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
2 ||| They takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .
2 ||| Barely gets off the ground .
1 ||| Even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , Miller 's hand often feels unsure .
1 ||| Pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer Adam Larson Broder and his co-director , Tony R. Abrams , in their feature debut .
3 ||| At its best , Queen is campy fun like the Vincent Price horror classics of the '60s .
0 ||| At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
1 ||| From the opening scenes , it 's clear that All About the Benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
0 ||| It takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but Ghost Ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
2 ||| On the bright side , it contains Jesse Ventura 's best work since the XFL .
2 ||| Despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected -LRB- even , at times , preposterous -RRB- turns , Love is just too , too precious in the end .
1 ||| A TV style murder mystery with a few big screen moments -LRB- including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether -RRB- .
1 ||| By getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , I found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .
0 ||| Too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
2 ||| Dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .
1 ||| Manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
1 ||| Do not see this film .
3 ||| Minority Report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
1 ||| Delivers the same old same old , tarted up with Latin flava and turned out by Hollywood playas .
1 ||| If you believe any of this , I can make you a real deal on leftover Enron stock that will double in value a week from Friday .
1 ||| To call The Other Side of Heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
0 ||| In exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if I 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , Formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
2 ||| If only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .
1 ||| I 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
2 ||| Without the dark spookiness of Crystal Lake Camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
0 ||| It 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication -LRB- and who knew they even had any ? -RRB- .
1 ||| While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
1 ||| For close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .
2 ||| To my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being Amoses and Andys for a new generation .
1 ||| What the director ca n't do is make either of Val Kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .
1 ||| In an effort , I suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
0 ||| It 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
2 ||| Harland Williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .
1 ||| ... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
1 ||| It 's not that Kung Pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all Oedekerk 's impish augmentation .
0 ||| A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .
0 ||| Not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
0 ||| A science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .
1 ||| Once -LRB- Kim -RRB- begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .
0 ||| The words , ` Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
2 ||| What 's next : `` My Mother the Car ? ''
1 ||| All the amped-up Tony Hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .
1 ||| A sequel that 's much too big for its britches .
0 ||| So unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
1 ||| What was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
2 ||| A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .
1 ||| For all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .
1 ||| A coarse and stupid gross-out .
1 ||| a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
1 ||| Does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
2 ||| There 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like Lavinia , to go the conservative route .
0 ||| It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
2 ||| The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
0 ||| But the power of these -LRB- subjects -RRB- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .
1 ||| Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
1 ||| Tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
0 ||| Paid In Full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from Brian De Palma 's Scarface .
1 ||| That 's a cheat .
3 ||| Harrison 's Flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
0 ||| This re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
1 ||| A string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity .
1 ||| The movie is Dawn of the Dead crossed with John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second .
1 ||| Basically a static series of semi-improvised -LRB- and semi-coherent -RRB- raps between the stars .
1 ||| Too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging ... The Isle defies an easy categorization .
2 ||| An unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer\/director John McKay can swallow .
3 ||| It 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible .
0 ||| `` The Time Machine '' is a movie that has no interest in itself .
0 ||| It does n't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor ... it 's just plain bored .
1 ||| ... a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it .
2 ||| A morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other .
2 ||| It 's a feature-length adaptation of one of those `` Can This Marriage Be Saved ? ''
2 ||| columns from Ladies Home Journal ...
2 ||| The film 's essentially over by the meet-cute .
2 ||| I 'm sure if you 're a Hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself ... Me , I did n't care for it .
3 ||| It 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think .
2 ||| Socrates motions for hemlock .
1 ||| The script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman -LRB- the actor -RRB- can make it work .
2 ||| Walter Hill 's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama Undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity .
1 ||| It has all the excitement of eating oatmeal .
2 ||| It 's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there 's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong .
2 ||| Although there are several truly jolting scares , there 's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at .
1 ||| I 'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film .
2 ||| Star Trek : Nemesis meekly goes where nearly every Star Trek movie has gone before .
0 ||| Wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by Silly Putty and Kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test Trekkie loyalty .
2 ||| Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .
1 ||| I do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool .
1 ||| Its well of thorn and vinegar -LRB- and simple humanity -RRB- has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks .
1 ||| For all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , Lily Chou-Chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam .
0 ||| Do n't be fooled by the impressive cast list - Eye See You is pure junk .
0 ||| Not since Freddy Got Fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through .
2 ||| The documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation .
1 ||| Plays like a volatile and overlong W magazine fashion spread .
1 ||| A better title , for all concerned , might be Swept Under the Rug .
1 ||| This movie seems to have been written using Mad-libs .
2 ||| There can be no other explanation .
3 ||| Hilariously inept and ridiculous .
1 ||| Vera 's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them .
0 ||| -LRB- A -RRB- shapeless blob of desperate entertainment .
1 ||| Feels too formulaic and too familiar to produce the transgressive thrills of early underground work .
0 ||| Given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing Soderbergh has ever done .
1 ||| a by-the-numbers patient\/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
1 ||| A dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going .
1 ||| Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
2 ||| Pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery .
3 ||| For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .
0 ||| With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here .
1 ||| It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .
1 ||| Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .
0 ||| -LRB- director -RRB- O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
2 ||| The intent is almost exactly the same -LRB- as The Full Monty -RRB- .
1 ||| All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .
0 ||| No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .
1 ||| Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
1 ||| There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
2 ||| It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .
3 ||| Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
1 ||| Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
2 ||| More maudlin than sharp .
3 ||| This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento -LRB- a producer here -RRB- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .
0 ||| It 's slow -- very , very slow .
1 ||| It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
1 ||| That 's pure PR hype .
1 ||| Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs .
1 ||| Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief .
1 ||| Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
0 ||| Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .
1 ||| There seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .
2 ||| If you 're a WWF fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in A.I. , you 'll probably like Rollerball .
0 ||| I do n't think I laughed out loud once .
0 ||| And when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .
1 ||| It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .
0 ||| Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
0 ||| ... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .
0 ||| The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
0 ||| My reaction in a word : disappointment .
0 ||| His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
2 ||| It kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others .
1 ||| Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .
3 ||| Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .
0 ||| Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
1 ||| For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
1 ||| I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .
2 ||| The vintage is pure ' 87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : Fatal Attraction = do n't have an affair with a nutjob ; Unfaithful = do n't if you 're married to one .
2 ||| A workshop mentality prevails .
0 ||| It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
0 ||| Yes , dull .
2 ||| Pumpkin wants to have it both ways .
1 ||| Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .
1 ||| -LRB- W -RRB- hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , Jane Goodall 's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .
1 ||| Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
0 ||| This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
1 ||| An occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .
0 ||| A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ...
2 ||| It 's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes .
0 ||| As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
2 ||| New Best Friend 's Playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous .
1 ||| The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
2 ||| Scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; Perdition , meanwhile , reads more like Driving Miss Daisy than GoodFellas .
2 ||| While the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target .
1 ||| As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .
1 ||| This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .
2 ||| This is her Blue Lagoon .
1 ||| The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .
1 ||| ... the film suffers from a lack of humor -LRB- something needed to balance out the violence -RRB- ...
1 ||| Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .
1 ||| An overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
0 ||| Has all the depth of a wading pool .
1 ||| This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
0 ||| The so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing -LRB- featuring the voices of Glenn Close , Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer -RRB- brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks .
0 ||| ... the movie is just a plain old monster .
2 ||| If this disposable tissue has one wild card , it 's John Turturro , who 's simply fab as a Spanish butler with a foot fetish .
1 ||| One long string of cliches .
1 ||| Fancy a real downer ?
2 ||| -LRB- Leigh -RRB- lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race .
0 ||| Professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
0 ||| Nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
2 ||| Weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger .
2 ||| But its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .
1 ||| At once half-baked and overheated .
2 ||| There 's a solid woman - finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you 'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it .
2 ||| I still ca n't relate to Stuart : He 's a mouse , for cryin ' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough .
3 ||| -LRB- Serry -RRB- wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition .
1 ||| It 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
2 ||| By the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , ... actually pretty good .
1 ||| Of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad .
1 ||| Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out .
2 ||| Exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids .
1 ||| Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
1 ||| The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
1 ||| I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
2 ||| A momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year .
2 ||| ... think of it as American Pie On Valium .
0 ||| Dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
0 ||| It 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
1 ||| With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .
2 ||| Some of it is clever , but it is never melodic \/
2 ||| Better to just call it ABC Kiarostami .
2 ||| For AIDS and Africa are nothing more than part of the scenery .
1 ||| No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
0 ||| This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
2 ||| Manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious .
2 ||| This rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that 's about all it does well .
1 ||| It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .
1 ||| As vulgar as it is banal .
1 ||| You wonder why Enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .
1 ||| The film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .
1 ||| The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .
1 ||| More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
0 ||| Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood .
1 ||| Coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .
1 ||| A wildly inconsistent emotional experience .
1 ||| Sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your DVD player will do it for you .
1 ||| A sometimes tedious film .
1 ||| Teen movies have really hit the skids .
0 ||| There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .
1 ||| ... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .
2 ||| Nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns .
0 ||| What is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
3 ||| does paint some memorable images ... , but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
2 ||| It uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color .
1 ||| just not campy enough
1 ||| The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
0 ||| It 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .
1 ||| Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .
0 ||| The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .
0 ||| For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
1 ||| American Chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an Indian-American would recognize .
1 ||| And the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
1 ||| It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
1 ||| Due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .
0 ||| ... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .
0 ||| So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises
1 ||| Combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , Beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest System of a Down video .
0 ||| Dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but Costner , flailing away .
1 ||| It 's a buggy drag .
1 ||| Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
1 ||| The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
0 ||| Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .
0 ||| Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
0 ||| Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .
0 ||| A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .
0 ||| There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .
3 ||| The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .
2 ||| Whereas last year 's exemplary Sexy Beast seemed to revitalize the British gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it .
1 ||| ... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause .
0 ||| Green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .
1 ||| I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers .
1 ||| There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
1 ||| The tale of Tok -LRB- Andy Lau -RRB- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of O -LRB- Takashi Sorimachi -RRB- , the most legendary of Asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .
1 ||| Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .
2 ||| A cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of -LRB- Besson 's -RRB- earlier work .
0 ||| A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .
0 ||| Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
3 ||| ... routine , harmless diversion and little else .
1 ||| Late Marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .
1 ||| This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .
3 ||| While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
1 ||| It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
2 ||| Let 's hope -- shall we ?
1 ||| There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
1 ||| If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
0 ||| In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .
1 ||| Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .
1 ||| But what are adults doing in the theater at all ?
0 ||| Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .
1 ||| It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
1 ||| Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .
0 ||| Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .
1 ||| The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .
1 ||| Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
3 ||| A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .
1 ||| Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
1 ||| To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
1 ||| At the very least , if you do n't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .
2 ||| The actors are appealing , but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .
0 ||| As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .
0 ||| The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
1 ||| There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .
2 ||| With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .
1 ||| It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
2 ||| Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .
1 ||| The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
1 ||| One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .
1 ||| Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
0 ||| The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .
1 ||| With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
0 ||| Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .
0 ||| A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .
2 ||| Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .
2 ||| It 's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .
1 ||| The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
1 ||| Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
1 ||| Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
2 ||| I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
1 ||| Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
1 ||| Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
3 ||| Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
1 ||| It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
0 ||| On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
1 ||| The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
1 ||| Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
0 ||| Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
1 ||| The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
1 ||| Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .
1 ||| It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
1 ||| Bad .
0 ||| Very bad .
0 ||| Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .
1 ||| May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
1 ||| If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .
1 ||| Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
1 ||| The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
1 ||| Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .
0 ||| The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .
2 ||| The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .
1 ||| Determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .
2 ||| Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit .
1 ||| But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
2 ||| Long Time Dead ?
2 ||| Not nearly long enough .
2 ||| Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .
3 ||| A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
1 ||| There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
1 ||| The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
1 ||| Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
1 ||| Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
3 ||| McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
1 ||| An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .
2 ||| Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .
2 ||| Who needs love like this ?
1 ||| Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .
2 ||| Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .
2 ||| Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .
0 ||| Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
0 ||| Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
1 ||| It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
2 ||| Whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .
1 ||| It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
1 ||| A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .
0 ||| Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
1 ||| I 'm just too bored to care .
1 ||| Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
2 ||| As befits its title , this PG-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear .
1 ||| Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
0 ||| It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .
1 ||| Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
1 ||| Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
2 ||| A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .
0 ||| Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?
0 ||| This is so bad .
2 ||| Even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .
2 ||| I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .
1 ||| Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .
1 ||| This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
1 ||| The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
1 ||| It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
0 ||| The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
2 ||| Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '
1 ||| At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
1 ||| A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .
1 ||| The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
1 ||| The end result is a film that 's neither .
1 ||| Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
1 ||| Something like scrubbing the toilet .
1 ||| Or emptying rat traps .
1 ||| Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .
3 ||| Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .
1 ||| \/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he 's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !
1 ||| Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
1 ||| There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
1 ||| However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
0 ||| The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
1 ||| But it could have been worse .
1 ||| Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
0 ||| Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
0 ||| comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .
1 ||| ... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
1 ||| it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
1 ||| It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
1 ||| The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
2 ||| Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn .
1 ||| Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .
